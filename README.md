# DIYOfficeNetworkBoard
An interactable message board to update a message of your choice!

Imagine a small, inexpensive device that can be mounted within an interior office window facing outwards 
(such as those by your professor’s door) and used to display messages from the occupant of that office, 
such as “Back in 5 minutes”, “Out to lunch”, or “Offices hours cancelled due to illness”. 
Now imagine that device un-tethered to any external network connection or wall-based power supply when in use, 
and also allowing the occupant to update the displayed message regardless of location. 
The code updates the screen whenever a new message is sent, and turns power off at the end of the day to save power.
 
With this project you will be able to create this device for yourself!
